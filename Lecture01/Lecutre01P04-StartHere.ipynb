    "# Git & GitHub\n",
    "In this class, we will be using git & GitHub to distribute & collect assignments as well as other class materials (e.g., slides, code, and datasets). For this lecture, we will only be covering how to download repositories from GitHub (called cloning in git terminology). Next lecture we will go more in depth into both git and GitHub, including how to submit your assignments.\n",

    "### GitHub Account\n",
    "The first thing you need is a GitHub account. If you don't already have one, go to the [GitHub Sign Up page](https://github.com/join) and create a free account. Once you have made your account, send your GitHub username to the email address written on the board.  Once you have been given access by the class instructor, you should be able to [view this document on GitHub](https://github.com/CISC879-BigData/UTK-COSC426and526-S23).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: if you add your utk.edu email address to your GitHub account, you will eligible for the [GitHub student pack](https://education.github.com/pack), which includes tons of free stuff (e.g., free premium GitHub account with unlimited private repos, free AWS credits, and free cloud hosting).\n",

    "### Git\n",
    "Now that you have a GitHub account, you need git.\n",
    " - If you are using Windows or Mac, you can download the [GitHub Desktop application](https://desktop.github.com/) to use git via a GUI.\n",
    "   - You can find GitHub's installation help [here](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started-with-github-desktop/).\n",
    "   - Once you have downloaded and installed GitHub Desktop, go ahead and login with your new account.\n",

    "# Anaconda\n",
    "In this class, we will be extensively using Python (specifically Python 3.7) as well as many Python packages (e.g., jupyter notebooks, pyspark, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, and pandas).  To ease the installation/use of these programming tools and ensure that the entire class is using the same environment, we will all be installing and using Anaconda.  Anaconda is a Python distribution that includes many popular packages by default and makes installing additional packages easy.  You can find more information about Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/).\n",

    "# Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "In this class, all of your assignments will be done in [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).  Jupyter Notebooks allow you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. We will give you a Jupyter Notebook that contains the problems that you must solve (in fact the document you are reading right now is a Jupyter Notebook).  Some of the problems we give you will already contain some template code that you can build off of. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For you own work beyond this class, [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a great alternative to Jupyter Notebooks for portable code that can be edited and executed via a web-browser.\n",
